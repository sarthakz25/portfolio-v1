            <p className="mb-4">
                Based in the vibrant tech hub of Mumbai, India, I live at the epicenter of innovation,
                continually developing my skills to contribute to the next wave of digital advancement.
                My fascination with technology started from taking gadgets apart to see how they work,
                all the way to staying up late tinkering with code. Lately, I've been focused on honing my
                skills in React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Flutter, Kotlin, Java, C++, and Python.
            </p>
