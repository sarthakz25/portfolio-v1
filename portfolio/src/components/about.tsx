            <p className="mb-5">
                Based in Mumbai, the vibrant tech hub of India, I am a driven third-year student at NMIMS MPSTME,
                with a lifelong fascination for technology. My curiosity evolved from disassembling gadgets to
                late nights spent coding, fueled by a belief in constant learning.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-7">
                I'm currently focused on refining my skills with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Flutter, Kotlin,
                Java and Python. When not coding, you can find me playing football, hitting the gym, or unwinding
                with music. I stay inspired by immersing myself in the latest tech innovations, always seeking
                new challenges to grow.
            </p>
